        <p><b>NilsAhr#4117</b>: Will the iPhone 12 come in September?</p>
        <blockquote>
        <p>The announcement probably will be, yeah.</p>
        </blockquote>

        

        <p><b>ivk1231#8356</b>: How did u become an Xda Developer ?</p>
        <blockquote>
        <p>I got a DM from someone and they asked "hey you wanna write for us" and I said sure. If you mean an actual developer, that's not really me. You can do that from the forums.</p>
        </blockquote>

        
        <p><b>Nguyen#3425</b>: Any new news on Apple Glass?</p>
        <blockquote>
        <p>Not at the moment.</p>
        </blockquote>

        
        <p><b>A13#4935</b>: Hello Max! Are you excited about Apple Glass and do you think it'll be popular?</p>
        <blockquote>
        <p>They seem like a really cool idea in concept. I was super excited for Focals 2.0 but those were cancelled unfortunately. I think they will be, they are a cool idea and people will probably like them</p>
        </blockquote>

        
        <p><b>Ô£ø ùêàùêßùêüùêûùê´ùêßùê® Ô£ø #2765</b>: Will the Apple Glass have a tinting feature?</p>
        <blockquote>
        <p>No clue, but I doubt it.</p>
        </blockquote>

        
        <p><b>lineliky45#8615</b>: What design will the cheaper iPhones have?</p>
        <blockquote>
        <p>I'd expect something similar to the iPhone 11 Pro but smaller and squared off sides.</p>
        </blockquote>

        
        <p><b>TriggeredGibberd#8981</b>: Will all the next iPhones have 5G or only certain models?</p>
        <blockquote>
        <p>It doesn't make sense for Apple to make 7 or 8 SKUs of the same phone. That would be about 20 around the world. It doesn't make sense to have both 4G and 5G. I'd expect 5G across the board with it disabled in some regions.</p>
        </blockquote>

        
        <p><b>Mbuuqw#9536</b>: How do you think the Pixel 4a will fare in the US against the iPhone SE 2?</p>
        <blockquote>
        <p>Against the SE? Probably not super well. For a Pixel phone? I could see it doing well.</p>
        </blockquote>

        
        <p><b>ruben10#4813</b>: Hi max, do you think the galaxy watch 3 will be available from announcement, since the watch is apparently in the backroom stock of some places, hence why some people have it already?</p>
        <blockquote>
        <p>I'd expect it on the same day as the Z Flip 5G, meaning August 7th.</p>
        </blockquote>

        
        <p><b>clacy04#6567</b>: o we've hear that the notch in the iPhone 12 are going to have a smaller notch but the same notch, what will actually happen with the notch this year?</p>
        <blockquote>
        <p>It's the same size. As I originally said, there were two prototypes, smaller and same size. It seems like they went with the same size notch.</p>
        </blockquote>

        
        <p><b>TorchAtlas#8962</b>: Do you think iPhone 12 will go USB-C finally?</p>
        <blockquote>
        <p>Nah, doubt it.</p>
        </blockquote>

        
        <p><b>WT#4877</b>: Hi! I can't wait for the Apple Over-ear headphones, do you know when they will be released?</p>
        <blockquote>
        <p>My guess is during the iPhone 12 launch event.</p>
        </blockquote>

        
        <p><b>NomtBmiased#0467</b>: What made you become a leaker?</p>
        <blockquote>
        <p>I did some APK teardowns then things happened and it happened. Nothing really made me become a leaker.</p>
        </blockquote>

        
        <p><b>gzell60#1047</b>: Are we going to see 120 Hz refresh rates on the iPhone 12 lineup?</p>
        <blockquote>
        <p>Unfortunately, no. Calibration is hard on 120hz display panels this year. Wait until next year with gen 2 panels</p>
        </blockquote>

        
        <p><b>bababooey#1942</b>: Do you think the score on appletrack represents you accurately as a leaker?</p>
        <blockquote>
        <p>Not really. Unlike most leakers, my sources are directly on teams working on products. Everything I say is accurate in the development cycle, but might not represent final products. I've been trying to be more clear about that recently.</p>
        </blockquote>

        
        <p><b>ivk1231#8356</b>: How to write for XDA ?</p>
        <blockquote>
        <p>There's a job page that got posted a few days ago. Highly recommend checking it out.</p>
        </blockquote>

        
        <p><b>clacy04#6567</b>: We've heard rumors about the iPhone 12 pro series having the lidar sensor on it, is that still happening and is it gonna be on the pro series or just the pro max?</p>
        <blockquote>
        <p>Not sure. I'd assume both because otherwise what's the difference between 6.1 non-pro and 6.1 pro.</p>
        </blockquote>

        
        <p><b>roccerfeller#7448</b>: Have you heard anything about the Apple Watch series 6 design and if it will be different to the S4/S5?</p>
        <blockquote>
        <p>Sounds like smaller bezel and new button layout.</p>
        </blockquote>

        
        <p><b>gzell60#1047</b>: Why do you think people are risking their jobs by leaking confident information to people like you? What are their intentions?</p>
        <blockquote>
        <p>People risk their jobs for the thrill of the leak. It's fun and as long as the leaker is smart and careful, there's little risk. It's not like they want to expose trade secrets, they know people are excited and want to put it out there. In some cases, it even works well for marketing.</p>
        </blockquote>

        
        <p><b>Patrick#1472</b>: Do you think we'll see a new Apple TV soon?</p>
        <blockquote>
        <p>I think there's a new one coming out in the next few months.</p>
        </blockquote>

        
        <p><b>MicroTechTon#6539</b>:  Is an iPhone your daily driver?</p>
        <blockquote>
        <p>Nah, the Z Flip and Find X2 Pro are. I do carry one though.</p>
        </blockquote>

        
        <p><b>dorus#7005</b>: Will the iPhone 12/12 pro get reverse wireless charging?</p>
        <blockquote>
        <p>No clue, probably tho.</p>
        </blockquote>

        
        <p><b>ruben10#4813</b>: Hi max, do you think there's a chance of the z fold 2 being released in August since it is being announced on the 5th?</p>
        <blockquote>
        <p>Nah. It'll be September or October.</p>
        </blockquote>

        
        <p><b>Misly#8067</b>: What is better in your opinion face id or touch?</p>
        <blockquote>
        <p>So straying away from Apple marketing here, I think both in a device is the best bet. Once you use something like the S10 5G, P40 Pro, or Mate 30 Pro, you realize having a fingerprint scanner under the display is by far the best and facial recognition as well. Just having one or the other is terrible imo. Basically, I have no favorite</p>
        </blockquote>

        
        <p><b>RealJoseph123#0001</b>: What do you think about the next generation iPad Air?</p>
        <blockquote>
        <p>Sounds like it's going to be good</p>
        </blockquote>

        
        <p><b>Nguyen#3425</b>: When do you think Apple will remove the notch entirely?</p>
        <blockquote>
        <p>I think so. I bet they go directly from full size notch to no notch. It just makes sense.</p>
        </blockquote>

        
        <p><b>A13#4935</b>: Higher end smartphones tend to cost $1,000+ these days, are you comfortable with the pricing or would you like to see cheaper phones across the industry?</p>
        <blockquote>
        <p>I'm fine with expensive phones. They are always the most advanced and usually the best. Cheaper options are great, but there's no reason to make the good phones worse just because they want to be cheaper. Having the option between expensive and cheap is just the best option.</p>
        </blockquote>

        
        <p><b>Ryonbread#0344</b>: Have you seen any information that could point towards a revival of 3d touch on a future iphone?</p>
        <blockquote>
        <p>Doubt it's coming back</p>
        </blockquote>

        
        <p><b>TorchAtlas#8962</b>: What do you think of atypical foldable form factors, like "tri-folding foldables"? Like that Xiaomi one from a while back? And what about rollables and flexible-screened phones, if those ever come along?</p>
        <blockquote>
        <p>I used one from TCL back in March and it was really cool but their hinge wasn't great in the prototype. I'd expect it to be much better when they come to market</p>
        </blockquote>


        <p><b>clacy04#6567</b>: Is there anything regarding touchID on the S6 Apple Watch?</p>
        <blockquote>
        <p>Would be cool. Could see an ultra sonic under display. That would be dope.</p>
        </blockquote>

        
        <p><b>roccerfeller#7448</b>: Other than the ram, stainless steel, Lidar, and size, is there anything else to differentiate the pro models this year now that smaller notch and 120 hz are not happening?</p>
        <blockquote>
        <p>Absolutely no idea. Maybe larger camera sensors?</p>
        </blockquote>

        
        <p><b>rHyS#8019</b>: are you looking forward for nearby sharing on android?</p>
        <blockquote>
        <p>It's on a bunch of my phones already and it's great to have. I just want it on iOS, Windows, and macOS.</p>
        </blockquote>

        
        <p><b>gzell60#1047</b>: When 'Apple Silicon' is discussed, we are usually talking about benefits for the Mac lineup. What additional benefits can we expect for iPhones down the road?</p>
        <blockquote>
        <p>Nothing, iPhones are already running Apple Silicon</p>
        </blockquote>

                
        <p><b>devdevmax#8864</b>: Have you ever attempt to repair or teardown any of your smartphones?</p>
        <blockquote>
        <p>I replaced my friends old iPhone 6 and I repaired the display on my Essential Phone after smashing it on a table.</p>
        </blockquote>


        <p><b>ruben10#4813</b>: Hi max, the z fold 2 is set to have some form of waterproofing, do you think it's a risk of Samsung to change their hinge design?</p>
        <blockquote>
        <p>It's a larger version of the Z Flip hinge and there's an oleophobic coating on the internals.</p>
        </blockquote>

        
        <p><b>invis#5591</b>: quThe silicon macs will have better performance. Will silicon macs bring the prices down as well?estion</p>
        <blockquote>
        <p>I wouldn't expect better performance quite yet. Maybe in a few years. I think prices will be the same or higher.</p>
        </blockquote>
        
        <p><b>Dobbo#8562</b>: Is ‚ÄòAirPower‚Äô a thing again - and is this a part of the whole port less thing?</p>
        <blockquote>
        <p>Apple never stopped working on AirPower but I doubt it'll be a huge thing.</p>
        </blockquote>

        
        <p><b>A13#4935</b>: Will the apple watch get rid of the digital crown for something solid state?</p>
        <blockquote>
        <p>Doubt it. Maybe if they change the actual design of the watch.</p>
        </blockquote>

        <p><b>bababooey#1942</b>: You've clearly been doing apple leaks for a while now. How did it all start? How did you get in touch with sources at apple?</p>
        <blockquote>
        <p>So the sources sent me a message on Discord saying "hey we work for apple" and I was like "cool cool probably not true but cool" but they told me some things, they ended up being true, and the rest is history.</p>
        </blockquote>


        <p><b>Patrick#1472</b>: Do you think Apple will release an LTE-enabled ARM MacBook Pro?</p>
        <blockquote>
        <p>I hope so</p>
        </blockquote>

        
        <p><b>TorchAtlas#8962</b>: People sometimes discuss how ethical it is to leak confidential products people work on. As exciting as leaks are, have you ever thought about this topic? After all not all engineers enjoy seeing their work be exposed prematurely, right?</p>
        <blockquote>
        <p>The ethics of it are weird. Is it unethical to expose a secret? Maybe. I'm usually ok with it. I don't see it as truly unethical. Selling that info to other companies would be, and also illegal so.</p>
        </blockquote>

        
        <p><b>dorus#7005</b>: What do you think will be the pricing of the iPhone 12 series?</p>
        <blockquote>
        <p>My guess is $800 for 12, $900 for 12 Max, $1050 for 12 Pro and $1150 for 12 Pro Max</p>
        </blockquote>

        
        <p><b>invis#5591</b>: What do we know about ProMotion in the iPhone and when do you think we will see it in an iPhone?</p>
        <blockquote>
        <p>We'll see it at some point in the future. That's about all I know.</p>
        </blockquote>

                
        <p><b>clacy04#6567</b>: Do you know anything regarding the redesigned iMac?</p>
        <blockquote>
        <p>Wait for Apple Silicon</p>
        </blockquote>

        
        <p><b>roccerfeller#7448</b>: Thank you for participating with us, Max. Some iPhone 12 series batteries were leaked and cause a worrisome stir online given their sizes relative to the iPhone 11 line. Have you heard anything about the battery life/performance on the iPhone 12 line?</p>
        <blockquote>
        <p>I haven't heard much but expect a small improvement over the 11 series.</p>
        </blockquote>

                
        <p><b>rHyS#8019</b>: do you think googles pixel phones have a bright future or do you think google is just going to stop making them?</p>
        <blockquote>
        <p>Google won't stop making them for a long time. I think Google needs to work on something things but they aren't bad at all.</p>
        </blockquote>

        
        <p><b>bababooey#1942</b>: You work a lot with EverythingApplePro, which is cool, though did you ever consider doing something more standalone and independent (in regards of Apple Leaks)?</p>
        <blockquote>
        <p>I've considered it. I've had some offers but I enjoy working with Filip. He truly cares about Apple and I like that.</p>
        </blockquote>

                
        <p><b>A13#4935</b>:  Do you know if we'll have a 16" Macbook Pro coming sometime early 2021 with Apple Silicon?</p>
        <blockquote>
        <p>My assumption is 2022.</p>
        </blockquote>

        
        <p><b>dorus#7005</b>: Leakers are saying that the battery on the iPhone 12 pro will be worse than on the 12 max what do you think?</p>
        <blockquote>
        <p>I don't know why it would be. 12 pro and 12 max are the same size with the 12 pro likely having a more efficient display. No reason to expect it to be worse.</p>
        </blockquote>

                
        <p><b>roccerfeller#7448</b>: Have you heard any news about Googles new mobile OS and when it could be released?</p>
        <blockquote>
        <p>It's not really a mobile OS. It's just a new OS with a custom kernel and all. It's not supposed to be a replacement to Android.</p>
        </blockquote>

        
        <p><b>WT#4877</b>: Do you think Apple will ever release a touchscreen laptop running iPadOS?</p>
        <blockquote>
        <p>Why would it run iPadOS? I bet we'll see a Mac with touch screen enough.</p>
        </blockquote>

        <blockquote>
        <p>The latest version of every OS is the best version to date. If you mean my favorite, I like iOS 6 or 7 (can't remember when they did the redesign) I had the most fun with that version. Since then it's been just kinda meh</p>

        <p>I love the iPad Pro. Best of the industry. To come out on top, Apple needs to get into foldables. That's not "reinventing the phone" that's just going with modern tech. They will be very behind when it happens.</p>

        <p>Why not a middle ground of both? That's my favorite, at least. I used the Vivo Nex 3 5G which had the absolute best hardware of 2019 and the software was so bad I couldn't use the phone. On the other hand, the Pixel 4 XL had pretty meh hardware but great software. I ended up using a OnePlus 8 Pro because the hardware is fantastic and basically the best but software is great and basically the best lol</p>
